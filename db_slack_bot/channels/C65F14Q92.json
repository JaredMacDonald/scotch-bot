{"id":"D650YUVSL","scotches":[{"name":"Glenlivet 15","value":"$80","description":"The unique use of French Oak increases the intensity of the whisky, resulting in a richer and creamier finish along with a distinctive spiciness. Deep golden in colour expect aromas and flavours of crème brûlée, sweet apple, gentle smokiness and peat alongside of lavendar notes followed by a rich and complex finish."},{"name":"Lagavulin 16","value":"$125.00","description":"Considered by many to be the benchmark for Islay malts this classic pours a golden amber colour and wafts from your glass with intense smoky peat and iodine. The palate is full flavour, rich and smooth with peat, figs, dates, and vanilla followed by an enduring smoky and dry finish."}]}
